# SimpleNetworking
Swift Package to simplify making network requests. Made with use cases using JSON responses and OAuth 2.0 for authentication in mind, but hopefully customizable for other use cases as well.

### Warning
This uses a development snapshot of Swift (specifically: 6.0 Development Snapshot 2024-06-06 a) so it can utilize throwing concrete error types
